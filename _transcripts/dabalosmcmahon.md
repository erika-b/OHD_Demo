This paper discusses discussed different historical connotations and events that contributed to
Lisa Dabalos-McMahon’s childhood directly and indirectly. We see how
wages for Latino farm workers were better in the Pacific Northwest based on bracero strikes
and how this is a feasible explanation for generations of Dabalos’ settling in Eastern
Washington. This research also highlights that Chicano movements were prevalent in Eastern
Washington and Lisa was exposed to varying opinions on the movements during her youth,
creating a safe space for her to explore her Latinx side. As she did not grow up speaking
Spanish or attending Spanish mass, it was inferred how these were indirect consequences of
generational racism which targeted Latinos in Eastern Washington. Lisa’s young adult life
centered on experiences and lessons learned while being a Latinx college student at Eastern
Washington University. In rural Latinx communities such as Moses Lake where she is from, the
sad reality is that many Chicanx young people do not have much opportunity and often resort to
a life in street gangs. Fortunately, she was able to attend college instead and complete her
undergrad at EWU while connecting to her Latinx identity through activities and organization
such as the Latino Student Union. Lisa’s adult life (from the mid 1990s to present) heavily
focused on motherhood and her career as an attorney. We see how she faced racism as a law
school student and as an attorney, and how these experiences drove her realistic changes in
family law, a system that historically targets low-income neighborhoods and BIPOC. Finally, she
shares how especially after Trump’s presidency, she strives to serve families threatened by
separation - Lisa has specialized in family law and deportation. Lisa’s story because it is a great
example of a powerful Latinx story in the United States.
